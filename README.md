- **Data Preprocessing**: Symbols for cleaning and tokenizing text
- **Model Training**: A depiction of a neural network or a training process
- **Prediction**: An output example showing hate speech vs. non-hate speech

You can use tools like Canva, Draw.io, or even Google Slides to create this diagram.
